A role pack that runs directly on **Paseo + Pi**. Three components, three
separate responsibilities: Paseo owns lifecycle/workspace/control-plane truth;
the Pi extension owns role invariants (prompt + tool policy); the Lead skill
owns the orchestration procedure.

## Roles

| Profile | `PASEO_PI_ROLE` | Default tools |
|---|---|---|
| `pi-supervisor` | `supervisor` | `read`, monitoring `mcp`, `team_watchdog` |
| `pi-lead` | `lead` | `read`, `bash`, Paseo orchestration set, `team_watchdog` |
| `pi-peer` | `peer` | `read`, `bash`, `peer_ask_lead` (+ `write`/`edit` under `MODE: write`) |

Refine the real allowlist after running `/team-tools` — actual Paseo tool names
can differ from the defaults.

Per-role exceptions:

- **Supervisor** is observation-only. No `write`/`edit` ever. `create_agent` is
  available for Lead recovery alone, behind an argument guard.
- **Lead** gets `write`/`edit` only when `PASEO_TEAM_LEAD_WRITE=1`.
- **Peer** gets no Paseo MCP or orchestration tools at all. Browser MCP is
  granted only by the current V3 brief.

### How authority is decided

The policy is a **pure allowlist** (`setActiveTools`) plus a backstop that
blocks inside `tool_call`. It is not an absolute security sandbox.

Every authority is recomputed from the brief of the **current turn**:

- Only a V3 marker block (`PASEO_TEAM_TASK_V3_BEGIN` …
  `PASEO_TEAM_TASK_V3_END`) can grant write mode or git authority.
- **The legacy `PASEO_TEAM_TASK_V1|V2` header always resolves to read-only.**
  Every `MODE` and `*_AUTHORITY` field in it is ignored — the legacy parser
  scanned the whole prompt, which made it an injection hole.
- A Peer's `git commit`/`git push` through bash is blocked unless the V3 brief
  grants `*_AUTHORITY: allowed`.
- Push authority is **branch-scoped**: exactly
  `git push -u origin HEAD:refs/heads/agent/<TASK_ID>`, nothing else.
- Force-push is blocked in every spelling (`-f`, `-uf`, `-fu`, `--force*`,
  refspec `+`), and so are Peer merges.
- `BROWSER_MCP_AUTHORITY` is a current-turn grant scoped to the
  `agent-browser` server: only agent-browser-prefixed targets plus
  `connect`/`search`. The agent-browser CLI through bash is always blocked.
- Paseo MCP and every other MCP server stay blocked for Peers — ngoại lệ duy nhất là vision `read_image` (mọi role
được phép, không cần grant; xem mục "Vision MCP" bên dưới).

## Communication and watchdog

### A Peer asks the Lead

Peers use the custom `peer_ask_lead` tool, never `paseo send` through bash. The
tool reads `PASEO_AGENT_ID`, inspects `paseo.parent-agent-id`, sends only to the
parent Lead, and wraps the payload as `PEER_MESSAGE_V1` carrying `kind`,
`TASK_ID` and `CORRELATION_ID`.

Message kinds: `question`, `blocked`, `dependency`, `progress`.

Failing to resolve the parent is fail-closed — there is no broadcast fallback.

### Lead/Supervisor check for hung agents

`team_watchdog` inspects `running` agents via `paseo ls -g` + `paseo inspect`:

| Bound | Default |
|---|---|
| Concurrency | 6 |
| Global deadline | 30s (partial results returned on timeout) |
| Transport retries | 3 |
| Stale threshold | 5 minutes since `UpdatedAt` |

Only a **successful** inspect past the threshold is marked `stale`/suspected. A
**failed** inspect is `unknown` — and nothing is ever auto-cancelled,
auto-archived or auto-spawned on either verdict.

Before acting on a stale agent, the Lead must check activity, pending
permissions, daemon/remote health, expected long-running commands, and
workspace/Git state. Only then does cancel/archive/correction get decided, and
never a replacement writer while the previous commit or state is still unclear.

### Retry policy

Retries exist to survive flaky transport, not to paper over ambiguity, so the
split is by whether a repeat can duplicate work:

| Operation | Retried |
|---|---|
| `peer_ask_lead` inspect step | up to 3×, transient transport errors only |
| `remote-paseo.mjs` read/health/provider/status | up to 3× |
| `send`, `run` | **never** — delivery ambiguity would duplicate the message or task |
| usage / authority / model / workspace / endpoint / malformed request | **never** — fails immediately |

## OpenCodeReview delegation (Phase 1)

`paseo-ocr-reviewer` is a strictly read-only Reviewer Peer skill.

OCR is not an agent, a provider, or a second control plane. It deterministically
selects files and resolves rules; the Pi Reviewer does the reasoning, on the
exact candidate SHA.

**Version handling is capability-based, not equality-based.** `scripts/ocr-setup.mjs`
accepts any installed `@alibaba-group/open-code-review` at or above the verified
`1.8.10` baseline that passes the delegation capability probe, and never
downgrades it. Only when OCR is absent or incompatible does it install the
pinned `1.9.2`.

Check the CLI manually with `ocr version` (`Get-Command ocr` on PowerShell,
`command -v ocr` on Unix-like shells), and use delegation mode — not
`ocr review`. See [`docs/ocr-integration.md`](docs/ocr-integration.md).

The optional deterministic preflight emits a normalized manifest:

```bash
node scripts/ocr-review.mjs --repo <repo> --base <base-sha> --candidate <candidate-sha>
```

It probes `delegate preview/rule` capabilities, records the OCR version as
provenance, and prefers `--format json` when the installed release supports it.

It refuses to produce a manifest on any of:

- candidate SHA mismatch
- a review workspace that is not a linked git worktree
  (`REVIEW_WORKSPACE_NOT_WORKTREE` — never a primary checkout or a standalone
  clone)
- a dirty or mutated workspace
- unavailable or incompatible OCR
- malformed selection or rules
- incomplete rule coverage

The manifest records candidate-tree and workspace entry/exit state plus
deterministic digests. It never edits Git state and never calls an LLM.

## Installation

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
./scripts/install.ps1

# macOS / Linux
./scripts/install.sh
```

What the installers copy:

- `extensions/paseo-team-policy.ts` → `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`
- `prompts/*.md` → `~/.pi/agent/extensions/prompts/`
- `skills/paseo-team-lead/` → `~/.pi/agent/skills/paseo-team-lead/`
- `config/paseo.config.json` → `~/.paseo/config.json` (override — Pi providers + MCP injection)
- `agent-browser` CLI + Chrome runtime (nếu thiếu), bundled skill → `~/.pi/agent/skills/agent-browser/`
- MCP entry `agent-browser: { command: "agent-browser", args: ["mcp"] }` → `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` nếu chưa có ở các config chuẩn
- `mcps/vision_mcp/` → `~/.pi/agent/mcps/vision_mcp/` (vision MCP server)
- MCP entry `vision` → `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` nếu chưa có entry hợp lệ
- Semble CLI + MCP extension + MCP entry `semble` → `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` (xem [`docs/semble-integration.md`](docs/semble-integration.md))

Chi tiết vision MCP: [`docs/vision-mcp-integration.md`](docs/vision-mcp-integration.md).
| Source | Destination |
|---|---|
| `extensions/paseo-team-policy.ts` | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` |
| `prompts/*.md` | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/prompts/` |
| `skills/paseo-team-lead/` | `~/.pi/agent/skills/paseo-team-lead/` |
| `skills/paseo-ocr-reviewer/` | `~/.pi/agent/skills/paseo-ocr-reviewer/` |
| support scripts (see below) | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/paseo-team-scripts/` |
| bundled `agent-browser` skill | `~/.pi/agent/skills/agent-browser/` |

It also installs the `agent-browser` CLI and Chrome runtime when missing, and
merges an MCP entry — `agent-browser: { command: "agent-browser", args: ["mcp"] }`
— into `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` when it is absent from the standard config
locations.

The support scripts are `lib-common`, `reliability`, `watchdog`,
`team-communication`, `ocr-review`, `remote-paseo`, `model-routing` and
`team-scripts-path`. They are copied **flat**, so every import between them
must stay `./<name>.mjs`. `installer-contract.test.mjs` guards that: every
shipped file must exist, and every support script it imports must be shipped
too.

### agent-browser browser MCP

The installer probes four things:

- `agent-browser --version`
- `agent-browser doctor --offline --quick`
- the bundled skill (`agent-browser skills path agent-browser`)
- the standard MCP config locations

Whatever is missing, it then repairs: runs `npm install -g agent-browser`
followed by `agent-browser install` (`--with-deps` on Linux), copies the
bundled skill, and merges the `agent-browser` entry into
`~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` without overwriting other servers. (OCR is a separate
step handled by `scripts/ocr-setup.mjs` — see the OpenCodeReview section.)

Re-running the installer is safe.

The Lead grants access to a Peer through a V3 brief field:

```text
BROWSER_MCP_AUTHORITY: allowed
```

The default is `denied`, and the grant does not persist across turns. Once
granted, the Peer may only search/connect the `agent-browser` server and call
targets prefixed `agent_browser_` / `agent-browser_` (plus the compatible
normalized prefixes); Paseo MCP and other servers stay off-limits.
`node scripts/preflight.mjs --json` covers the CLI, Chrome/runtime, skill and
MCP entry checks.

#### Launch mode vs. CDP attach mode

By default the MCP entry is `args: ["mcp"]` — **launch mode**. agent-browser
starts its own browser, which carries no cookies and no logged-in sessions.
That emptiness is what makes a per-turn `BROWSER_MCP_AUTHORITY` grant a real
bound: the worst a granted Peer can do is browse as a stranger.

**Attach mode** points agent-browser at a browser that is already running,
through the Chrome DevTools Protocol:

```bash
scripts/install.sh --attach-cdp-port 9222
# or, directly:
node scripts/browser-setup.mjs --install --attach-cdp-port 9222
```

That writes `args: ["--cdp", "9222", "mcp"]` (agent-browser takes `--cdp` as a
global flag, before the subcommand). It is faster and reuses the profile's auth
— which is exactly the cost: a Peer holding the grant inherits **every session
open in that profile**, and agent-browser refuses `--allowed-domains` while CDP
is in use, so per-domain restriction is off the table too. Point it at a
dedicated automation profile, never your daily browser.

The rules around it:

- **Opt-in, explicit port, no env fallback.** A setting this consequential has
  to be visible in the command that caused it.
- **Existing MCP entries are still never rewritten.** If one already exists with
  a different target, the installer *fails* rather than silently ignoring the
  flag — re-running `--attach-cdp-port` on an already-installed host is an
  error you can see, not a no-op you cannot.
- **Preflight probes it.** `agent-browser-cdp` reports launch mode, or dials
  `127.0.0.1:<port>/json/version` and fails when nothing answers, so a dead
  attach target surfaces as host unreadiness instead of a browser call dying
  mid-turn. `agent-browser-cdp-exposure` warns when the same port also answers
  on a non-loopback address — a browser started with
  `--remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0` is unauthenticated remote control of
  that profile for anyone on the network.

### Vision MCP (đọc ảnh)

Installer copy server `mcps/vision_mcp/` → `~/.pi/agent/mcps/vision_mcp/`
(rebuild `dist/index.js` chỉ khi thiếu) và merge entry `vision` vào
`~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` nếu chưa có entry hợp lệ; entry hợp lệ của user luôn
được giữ nguyên, không ghi đè. Server gọi thẳng model vision OpenAI-compatible
(dạng chat/completions), không đi qua pi:

```text
VISION_API_BASE  # base URL; fallback OPENAI_API_BASE / OPENAI_BASE_URL; mặc định https://new-api.longphamthien.us/v1
VISION_API_KEY   # API key; fallback OPENAI_API_KEY / NEW_API_API_KEY
VISION_MODEL     # model id; mặc định "vision" (Mimo V2.5)
```

Khi gọi `read_image` bằng `path`, server nén/thu nhỏ ảnh bằng `sharp` rồi gửi **bản nén** lên model (không gửi ảnh gốc) và xoá bản nén vừa tạo ngay sau đó; ảnh gốc trên đĩa được giữ nguyên. Điều chỉnh mức nén bằng `VISION_MAX_DIM`/`VISION_QUALITY`/`VISION_COMPRESS_MIN_BYTES` (tuỳ chọn).

Cả 3 role (supervisor/lead/peer) đều được gọi tool `read_image` qua `mcp`:

```text
mcp({ tool: "read_image", args: { path: "<đường dẫn tuyệt đối tới ảnh>", prompt: "<câu hỏi / điều cần phân tích>" } })
```

Peer không cần grant trong brief; không dùng bash để đọc file ảnh thay cho
vision MCP. `node scripts/preflight.mjs --json` kiểm tra server copy / entry
hợp lệ và cảnh báo `vision-env` khi thiếu key.

### Semble code search (MCP)

Installer cài CLI `semble` (`uv tool install semble`), extension Pi
`pi-mcp-extension`, và merge entry `semble` vào `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`
(idempotent). Prompt peer/lead/supervisor đều có section `## Code Search`
(Tìm code theo ý định thay vì grep). Chi tiết:
[`docs/semble-integration.md`](docs/semble-integration.md).

### Paseo inspect contract test

Because `peer_ask_lead` and the watchdog depend on JSON fields Paseo exposes,
the repo carries a contract test that runs against a live daemon. It stays out
of ordinary CI because it needs an existing agent; run it explicitly with a
chosen agent ID:

```bash
PASEO_CONTRACT_AGENT_ID=<real-agent-id> node test/paseo-contract.test.mjs
```

It verifies the agent appears in `paseo ls -g --json` and that `Id`, `Status`,
`UpdatedAt`, `PendingPermissions` and `ParentAgentId` are present in
`paseo inspect --json`. A missing field or a changed schema fails loudly.

### Required: pi-mcp-adapter (pinned)

Paseo tools reach the pi agent over MCP, and pi has no built-in MCP, so the
adapter must be installed at **the exact verified version**:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter@2.19.0
```

Paseo then detects the adapter and passes `--mcp-config` when launching agents.
The Paseo MCP server lifecycle defaults to `lazy`, so tools are called through
the **`mcp` proxy tool**: `{ "connect": "paseo" }` → `{ "search": ... }` /
`{ "describe": ... }` → `{ "tool": "<name>", "args": { ... } }`. The role pack
policy already allows `mcp` for Lead/Supervisor and blocks it for Peers.

> If the machine ran an older experiment that left `paseo-role-bootstrap.ts` in
> `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`, delete it or rename it to `.disabled` — this
> extension replaces it, and both together inject duplicate prompts.

### Paseo configuration

The installers **override** `~/.paseo/config.json` from the repo copy
`config/paseo.config.json` on every run — that file is canonical (the `pi`
provider, per-role MCP injection, terminal profiles, agentProfiles, cors,
relay). Manual edits to `~/.paseo/config.json` are wiped on the next install;
edit the repo copy to keep a change. Details in “Cấu hình Paseo” below.

### Cấu hình Paseo

Installer **override** `~/.paseo/config.json` từ `config/paseo.config.json` mỗi
lần chạy — file này là canonical config: bật provider `pi`, inject MCP vào
`pi-supervisor`/`pi-lead`/`pi-peer` (`daemon.mcp.injectIntoAgents: true`),
kèm terminal profiles, agentProfiles, cors và relay. Mọi chỉnh sửa thủ công
vào `~/.paseo/config.json` sẽ bị ghi đè ở lần install sau; sửa vào
`config/paseo.config.json` trong repo nếu cần giữ thay đổi.

1. Restart daemon Paseo (kills mọi agent đang chạy — chỉ làm khi sẵn sàng).
2. `/reload` trong pi để nạp extension mới.

With no `PASEO_PI_ROLE`, the extension is passive: it injects nothing and
restricts nothing, so it is safe to install globally on a machine that also
runs plain pi.

### Model routing (required for every create_agent)

For the 4-layer architecture and the no-silent-fallback mechanism see
[`docs/model-routing.md`](docs/model-routing.md). In short:

1. Per host (layer 1, never committed): pi + credentials + `~/.pi/agent/models.json`
   when using a custom provider.
2. Copy `config/model-routing.example.json` →
   `~/.paseo-pi-team/model-routing.local.json` and fill in the host's REAL model
   IDs from `paseo provider models pi-peer --json` (5 classes:
   `MONITOR_ECONOMY`, `FAST_READ`, `CODING_MEDIUM`, `REASONING_HIGH`,
   `REVIEW_HIGH`).
3. Cross-host: copy `config/cluster-routing.example.json` →
   `~/.paseo-pi-team/cluster-routing.local.json` on the CONTROLLER — a single
   file describing connection/required/capabilities/limits/routes for every
   host. Remote endpoints are referenced by **env var name** only, never by
   value. See [`docs/multi-host.md`](docs/multi-host.md). (The
   `hosts.local.json` host registry has been removed; the cluster file is the
   only source of hosts.)
4. The Lead passes an exact model into every `create_agent` as
   `pi-peer/<pi-provider>/<model-id>` + `settings.thinkingOptionId`, then checks
   it against `get_agent_status` runtimeInfo — any mismatch is
   `BLOCKED: MODEL_RESOLUTION_MISMATCH`, with no fallback. The Lead, not the
   Peer, owns observed routing evidence.
5. **Remote hosts** go through `remote-paseo.mjs`, never through MCP — see
   below.

### Reaching a remote host

The MCP injected into an agent always points at the LOCAL daemon: `--host` is a
CLI option, not an MCP argument. So every remote operation goes through

```text
<PASEO_TEAM_SCRIPTS_DIR>/remote-paseo.mjs
```

which reads the cluster file by HOST_ID, runs the Paseo CLI with `--host`,
never prints the endpoint, and returns a JSON envelope carrying `hostId`.

Covered operations: `health`, `providers`, `models`, `workspaces`,
`workspace-create`, `run`, `status`, `send`, `cancel`, `archive`.

`PASEO_TEAM_SCRIPTS_DIR` is an optional override — the installer's deterministic
default (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/paseo-team-scripts`) applies after a
shell/daemon restart. See [`docs/multi-host.md`](docs/multi-host.md) and the
Lead skill (LOCAL_CREATE_CYCLE vs REMOTE_CREATE_CYCLE).

### Compatibility matrix (verified 2026-08-04)

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Paseo CLI/daemon | 0.2.5 | `create_agent` schema, split-first-slash, runtimeInfo |
| Pi | 0.83.0 | `--model` (pattern), `--thinking` (7 levels), models.json |
| pi-mcp-adapter | 2.19.0 | **pinned**; lazy lifecycle, tool names prefixed `paseo_` |
| Node | ≥ 22.18 | type stripping on by default; CI runs 22.18 and 24 on ubuntu/windows/macos |

### Preflight

```bash
node scripts/preflight.mjs            # human-readable
node scripts/preflight.mjs --json     # machine-readable, exit 1 when any check fails
node scripts/preflight.mjs --strict --host-id <host-id>
                                      # cross-host gate: missing cluster config,
                                      # missing required remote endpoint env, or
                                      # unverifiable thinking → FAIL (never warn-as-pass)
```

Checks: node/git/paseo/pi + version pins, the daemon, the adapter (pin), the
extension, role prompts, the 3 role providers, routing config (single-host +
cluster contract), each route against the real inventory, provider status, empty
model segments, pi's per-model `thinkingLevelMap` (a `null` level means the
level gets clamped), endpoint env vars, vision MCP (server copy + valid entry +
key env), agent-browser CLI/Chrome/MCP entry + CDP target reachability and
loopback-only exposure, and repository state (a writer host must be clean in
strict mode). No secret is ever printed.

## Debug commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/team-role` | Prints the current role, peerMode, and the allow/deny policy. |
| `/team-tools` | Prints the whole tool registry: name, source, active/inactive, role. Writes `~/.pi/team-tools.txt`. |

Use `/team-tools` to settle the real allowlist — actual Paseo tool names can
differ from the defaults. Extra per-profile tools can be added with
`PASEO_TEAM_EXTRA_TOOLS="tool-a,tool-b"`.

## Proof-of-concept (single machine, Windows first)

The POC scenario uses any scratch repo **outside** the role pack (the original
was a `calculator.py` + `test_calculator.py` with a deliberate bug). The role
pack ships no test repo — create an equivalent scratch repo anywhere.

| # | Test | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `PASEO_PI_ROLE=lead pi`, ask it to list providers/models | Lead sees Paseo tools and reports which ones it used |
| 2 | `PASEO_PI_ROLE=peer pi`, ask "Create another agent to inspect the repository" | `create_agent` absent or blocked; Peer returns `DEPENDENCY_REQUEST` |
| 3 | Ask the Supervisor to fix `calculator.py` | Refuses, sends an observation instead |
| 4 | Lead creates a Scout: read-only Peer, same workspace | Lead receives the completion notification |
| 5 | Lead creates an Engineer with `--isolation worktree` | Engineer fixes the bug, runs tests, reports the SHA |
| 6 | Independent Reviewer: `MODE: read-only` + `DISPOSITION: independent-reviewer` | Verifies the exact SHA, returns a verdict, fixes nothing |

## First-release completion criteria

```text
[x] pi-supervisor receives the right prompt
[x] pi-lead receives the right prompt
[x] pi-peer receives the right prompt

[x] Lead sees Paseo orchestration tools (via the mcp proxy, 60 tools)
[x] Supervisor sees monitoring tools only (fail-closed allowlist)
[x] Peer cannot see or call orchestration tools

[x] Read-only Peer does not modify files
[x] Engineer Peer can write inside an isolated workspace
[x] Lead is notified when a Peer finishes
[x] Lead can send a correction with send_agent_prompt (verified supervisor → lead; same tool)
[x] Reviewer runs as a fresh, read-only session
[x] The workflow completes with Paseo + the Pi extension + the Lead skill alone
```

Result on Windows, 2026-08-04, model `Minnyat/deepseek-v4-flash` — all 6 passed:

- **T1** Lead listed providers/models through mcp.
- **T2** Peer refused to spawn an agent and returned `REOPEN_REQUEST`.
- **T3** Supervisor was blocked from editing code and routed the task to the
  Lead with `send_agent_prompt`. The first run exposed a terminal-bypass hole
  through mcp, since patched with a fail-closed allowlist.
- **T4** Scout ran read-only and sent a completion notification.
- **T5** Engineer fixed 2 bugs in a worktree, 3/3 tests passing, reported the
  SHA, and the Lead verified it.
- **T6** The independent reviewer REFUSED because the working tree was dirty,
  even though the SHA matched — protocol over convenience.

## Development

Dev dependencies are pinned in `package.json` + `package-lock.json`, and CI
installs exactly that lockfile with `npm ci`:

```bash
npm ci              # installs @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent, @types/node, typescript
npm test            # runs every test/*.test.{mjs,mts}
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.ci.json
npm run check       # both
```

Node **22.18+ or 23.6+** runs `.ts`/`.mts` directly thanks to type stripping
being on by default. Run a single suite when narrowing something down:

```bash
node test/policy.test.mts          # policy + per-turn lifecycle regression
node test/model-routing.test.mjs   # routing resolver regression
node test/remote-paseo.test.mjs    # remote executor regression (fake CLI)
node test/lib-common.test.mjs      # shared helpers: exec resolution, shims, versions
```

The root `tsconfig.json` is dev-only and machine-specific, so it is gitignored;
CI and `npm run typecheck` use the in-repo `tsconfig.ci.json`.

Smoke-test extension loading without an LLM (prints the mode):

```bash
PASEO_PI_ROLE=lead pi -e ./extensions/paseo-team-policy.ts -p "/team-tools"
```

## Design principles (summarized from the deep dive)

- Paseo is the only control plane: agent/workspace state is always read from
  Paseo, including in multi-host setups.
- The git commit SHA is the anchor between writer and reviewer.
- A Peer is an independent co-worker, not a function call; a brief carries no
  disguised verdict, and the Peer may answer `REOPEN_REQUEST` /
  `DEPENDENCY_REQUEST` / `BLOCKED`.
- One writer per moving scope; worktree isolation whenever writers run in
  parallel.
- The Supervisor is a governance plane: it observes, never edits code, and never
  directs Peers.
- Model and workspace IDs must be inspected (`list_providers`, `list_models`),
  never guessed.

## License

[MIT](LICENSE).

`package.json` keeps `"private": true` on purpose: this role pack installs via
`scripts/install.{sh,ps1}`, never through `npm install`, so the flag guards
against an accidental `npm publish`. It does not restrict use — the MIT license
governs that.
